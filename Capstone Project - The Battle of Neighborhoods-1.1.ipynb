Using this library we can extract the data in the tabular format as shown in the\nwebsite. After the web scraping, string manipulation is required to get the names of the boroughs in the correct form. This is important because we will be merging the\ntwo datasets together using the Borough names.\nThe two datasets are merged on the Borough names to form a new dataset that combines the necessary information in one dataset. The purpose of this dataset is to\nvisualize the crime rates in each borough and identify the borough with the least crimes recorded during the year 2016.\n\nAfter visualizing the crime in each borough we can find the borough with the lowest crime rate and hence tag that borough as the safest borough. The third source of data is acquired\nfrom the list of neighborhoods in the safest borough on wikipedia. This dataset is created from scratch, the pandas data frame is created with the names of the neighborhoods and the\nname of the borough with the latitude and longitude are left blank.\n\nThe coordinates of the neighborhoods is be obtained using Google Maps API geocoding to get the final dataset.
